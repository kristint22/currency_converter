# Overview

I thought it would be fun to learn C++ since I already know C# and they are related since they come from the same source. I thought it would be interesting to see the similarities and the differences between the two languages.I was hoping that by learning C++ I could not only gain important knowledge, but I was also hopeful that this would help my to become more confident with C#. My goal is to create a successful and working currency converter. 

This currency converter asks the user for the amount they want exchanged and what they want converted to from a list of currencies. Then it figures out how much it would convert to and if you gave a currency that is from the list. Once it is done and shows you the amount, it asks if you would like to convert again. This process continues until the user says that they are done. 

My purpose was to learn how to implement user interaction, use conditional statements, how structures work, as well as while loops and how C++ uses those and other features. I also wanted to learn how to make an easy currency converter that has the potential to be more maintainable an efficient.

# Future Work

Things I can do to make it better!

- Modify it so that it can read and write to file
- turn it into a do-while loop instead of while
- simplify the conditional statements by either: creating a function or two,a switch, or a for-loop.
