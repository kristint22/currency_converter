# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
I thought it would be fun to learn C++ since I already know C# and they are related since they come from the same source. 
I was hoping that I by learning C++ I could not only gain important knowledge, but I was also hopeful that this would help my to become more confident with C#.
My goal is to create a successful and working currency converter. 

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
